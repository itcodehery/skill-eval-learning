# Git and GitHub
Git is the local (saved on your pc, not online) savepoint creating tool.
GitHub is just a server to store your offline git repository. 

Repository = our whole project folder along with each and every changes we make throughout time.

Commit = a savepoint in time. We can go back to any commit we want.

Github is used by open source communities to share their code with the world. 
It is also used by companies to share their code with their employees.

Cloning: Saving online hosted Git Repos to your local machine.

Pushing: Sending your local git repo to an online hosted git repo.

Pulling: Getting the latest version of an online hosted git repo to your local machine.

Staged and Unstaged Changes: Putting whatever is changed into a container and then saving it to a commit.

Branches: Creating a copy of your project to work on without affecting the main project.

Merges: Merging two commits into a single new commit/ merging two branches into a single branch.
