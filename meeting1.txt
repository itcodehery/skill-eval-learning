# Git and GitHub
Git is the local (saved on your pc, not online) savepoint creating tool.

GitHub is just a server to store your offline git repository. 


Repository = our whole project folder along with each and every changes we make throughout time.

Commit = a savepoint in time. We can go back to any commit we want.

Github is used by open source communities to share their code with the world. 
It is also used by companies to share their code with their employees.
